# MakeupAlley-revamp


## Synopsis

makeupalley.com is one of the oldest and reputable makeup review sites on the internet. They have thousands of active members and a large database of product reviews and forum topics. The website has not changed much in the many years of it's existence so it is time for a virtual facelift.


## To revamp the MakeupAlley website, the following will need to be considered (MVP):

- A landing page for the user to sign up or sign in
- An index page that will display the user's profile information.
- An index page of products that can be reviewed.
- A show page for  a specific product that will display an image, description and list of reviews placed on the product.
- A new form to submit a review.
- An edit form to edit an existing review submitted by the user.
- an index page with forum topics.
- a show page that displays all comments submitted to that topic.
- A new page to submit a comment.
- An edit page to edit an existing comment submitted by the user.
 
## User Stories:

- User can sign up and create an account.
- User can see an image of the product and a brief description of the product being reviewed.
- User can submit a review on a product.
- User can view existing reviews on a product.
- USer can comment in a forum.
- User can view a complete thread of comments on a product.
- User can delete a comment or review that they have submitted.



## Motivation

Makeupalley.com has always been a site I visited frequently but I was always frustrated with their dated design and unintuitive layout. I always hoped that someone would take the step to bring makeupalley.com into the current trend of web development and I guess now I will be that person.
